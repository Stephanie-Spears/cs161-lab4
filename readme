-- Lab04 Readme

For this lab we are going to get more practice writing and compiling programs
on linux. The purpose is to gain experience using a text editor and the
compiler.  It is assumed that you have already done all previous lab
exercises.

-- Setup

Use the instructions in the previous lessions to create a new directory called
"lab04" in your "labs" directory.  After you have created the directory make
sure that you "go into" the "lab04" directory (Hint: "go into x" means "change
your current directory to x").

-- Creating a bar chart

Your program for this lab exercise will create a horizontal bar chart.  The
program will prompt the user to enter 5 integers and then display those values
as a bar chart.  The program should make sure that the integers that the user
enters are between 0 and 10, inclusive.

This is an example run of how your program should work:

Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):10
Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):9
Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):0
Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):1
Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):-1
Invalid value.  Try again.
Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):5
**********
*********

*****

The program needs to have at least three functions: getValue(), printRow(),
main().  The getValue() function will prompt the user to enter a value and
make sure it is in the proper range.  It will return the value.  The
printRow() function will take in a value and print a row containing "value"
number of "*" characters.  The main() function will be the main driver for
calling the getValue() and printRow() functions.

-- Lab completion

To show that you have completed the lab you need to turn in the assignment
using the "turnin" program.  The command to turn in your file is
"~mike.noel/bin/turnin cs161 filename".  Replace "filename" with the actual
name of your file.  This command only generates output if there is an error.
